This code only works with the xia-v2 branch. There are some to the values in the packet headers that have changed.

If you use this, let me know of any suggestions or issues you run into.


git clone https://github.com/XIA-Project/wireshark.git
apt-get install autogen autoconf libtool libtool-bin bison byacc flex libpcap-dev libgtk-3-dev

cd wireshark
git checkout xia
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
….. wait awhile

Use the following command to run wireshark for now since it’s not installed in the default location
sudo WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY=1 ./wireshark-gtk



useful wireshark capture filters  (in teh capture options dialog)

- only capture XIA packets (excludes Xnetj packets since we can easily dissect them)
(ether proto 0xc0de) || (ether proto 0x9990)

- capture xnetj too
(ether proto 0xc0de) || (ether proto 0x9990) || (ether proto 0x9991)

- capture XIA but filter out xarp, xnetj, and xroute packets
(ether proto 0xc0de) && !(ether dst ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)



useful wireshark display filters (in the toolbar)
These can be used with or without the capture filters, but won’t display things that were ignored by the capture filter

xip
xdgram
xstream
xarp
add && !(ether.dst ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) to any of the above to filter our noisy daemon traffic if you didn’t use a capture filter

Note: it’s ether.dst for the display filter and ether dst for the capture filter.



if you edit the /etc/ethers file, wireshark will show friendly names instead of mac addresses in it’s display. Mine looks like

00:0c:29:dc:e4:36 h0
00:0c:29:3f:52:3c r0
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff Broadcast
